# Horiseon Website Refactoring ticket

## Introduction

Welcome to the repo for my refactoring work on the homepage for a marketing company named Horiseon Social Solution. The company wanted to incorporate semantic elements into its code as well as improve the website's accessibility. As a junior web developer, this task required lots of time, learning on the go and improvisation. In the end, I feel I have completed the task as assigned.
